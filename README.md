Fashion-mnist clothing classification


Overview:
Fashion-MNIST dataset is a collection of photos from fashion-related articles. It can be used for learning and applying deep convolutional neural network development, evaluation, and application for image classification.
This code proposes a deep learning model using the tensorflow framework to handle the problem. We create a classification model.
Framework used: Tensorflow

Problem Statement:
The market for online fashion is always growing. To boost sales or comprehend consumers better, an artificial intelligence system that recognises and categorises human clothes is needed. Businesses in the clothes sales industry can benefit from an algorithm that can recognise apparel by using it to determine the profile of potential customers and concentrate on sales that are aimed at specific niches.


Result:
We predict the class of image it belongs to.
